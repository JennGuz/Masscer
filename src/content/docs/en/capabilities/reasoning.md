## What Are Reasoning Models?

The **o1** series reasoning models by OpenAI are large language models trained to perform complex reasoning using advanced reinforcement learning techniques. These models are designed to "think before responding," generating an internal chain of reasoning before providing an answer.

### Key Features:
1. **Deep Thinking**: o1 models generate long, detailed chains of thought to arrive at well-reasoned conclusions.
2. **High Performance**: 
   - 89th percentile in competitive programming questions on Codeforces.
   - Ranked among the top 500 students in the US Mathematical Olympiad (AIME).
   - Surpassed human PhD-level accuracy in physics, biology, and chemistry benchmarks (GPQA).
3. **Flexible Options**:
   - **o1**: Designed to solve challenging problems using broad general knowledge.
   - **o1-mini**: A faster and more affordable version, ideal for coding, math, and science tasks where extensive general knowledge is not required.
