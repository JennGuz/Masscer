title: Completions in Masscer
description: Learn what completions are, how they work, their benefits, and how to generate them from documents and conversations in Masscer.

Completions are one of the key features in AI language models. They allow for the automatic and coherent generation of text based on an initial input (prompt). They are used in multiple applications, from content generation to virtual assistants.

## What is a Completion?

A **completion** is the continuation of a text generated by a language model based on a given context. The model analyzes the input prompt and predicts the best sequence of words to logically and coherently complete the response.

Example of use:

**Input (prompt):**  
*"The sun sets on the horizon and the birds begin to..."*  

**Output (generated completion):**  
*"sing softly as the night breeze cools the air."*

## How Does a Completion Work?

The text generation process through completions follows several steps:

1. **User Input (Prompt):** An initial text is provided to define the context.  
2. **Model Analysis:** The AI model evaluates linguistic patterns and word probabilities.  
3. **Output Generation:** The AI predicts and generates the most probable or creative continuation based on the defined parameters.  
4. **Result Delivery:** The generated completion is displayed to the user.  

Some key parameters that affect the behavior of a completion include:

- **Temperature:** Controls the randomness of the response (low values = more predictable, high values = more creative).  
- **Max tokens:** Defines the maximum number of words or characters generated.  
- **Top-p (nucleus sampling):** Adjusts word selection based on cumulative probabilities.  
- **Frequency penalty:** Reduces word repetition in the response.

## Completion Parameters

When generating completions, you can configure certain parameters to optimize the results:

- **Number of Completions to Generate:** Determines how many different responses will be created. A higher number of completions offers more variety, while a lower number focuses on more specific options.
- **Agent Selection:** Allows you to define which AI agents will use the generated completions, ensuring that each one is trained for specific contexts.

## Generating Completions from Documents

To generate completions from documents in Masscer, follow these steps:

1. **Upload the Document:** In the chat, click on the document icon and select the file you want to use.
2. **Access the Sidebar:** Go to the side menu and click on "Documents."
3. **Select the Document:** You will see the uploaded document. Click on "Options" and then "Train with this document."
4. **Configure the Process:** Define the number of completions to generate according to your needs.
5. **Generate Completions:** Click "Generate" to start the process.

> **Importance of defining the number of completions:** This allows you to control the variety of generated responses. If you need to explore multiple approaches, generate more completions. If you seek more precise answers, opt for a lower number.

## Generating Completions from Conversations

To create completions based on previous conversations:

1. **Access the Sidebar:** Click on "Conversations" in the side menu.
2. **Select the Conversation:** Find the relevant conversation and click on "Options."
3. **Train with the Conversation:** Select "Train" to start the process.
4. **Configure and Generate:** Just like with documents, choose the number of completions to generate and click "Generate."

## Objective of a Completion

The objective of a **completion** is to generate coherent, relevant, and context-aware responses based on a prompt or a source of information. In Masscer, completions enable:

- **Improved communication:** Generating natural and fluid responses in automated conversations.  
- **Enhanced information analysis:** Extracting insights and summarizing data from documents and conversations.  
- **Optimized content creation:** Writing texts for blogs, social media, and technical documentation more efficiently and accurately.  
- **Automation of repetitive tasks:** Streamlining processes in areas such as customer support, education, and report generation.  

Masscer provides advanced tools to personalize completion generation, ensuring that the generated responses are precise, useful, and tailored to each specific context.
