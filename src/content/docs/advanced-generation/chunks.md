title: Chunks in Masscer
description: Learn what chunks are, their importance in data processing, how they work, and how they are used in Masscer.
---

**Chunks** are fragments of text into which a document or conversation is divided to facilitate processing. They are used in artificial intelligence and language models to improve efficiency and accuracy in text generation and analysis.

## What is a Chunk?

A **chunk** is a portion of text extracted from a document or conversation that is processed individually. Instead of analyzing an entire text at once, it is divided into smaller parts, allowing AI models to better handle information and generate more precise responses.

Example of chunking in a document:

**Original text:**  
*"Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the way we interact with technology. Language models enable automatic text generation and highly accurate question answering."*

**Generated chunks:**  
1. *"Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the way we interact with technology."*  
2. *"Language models enable automatic text generation and highly accurate question answering."*

## What Are Chunks Used For?

The use of **chunks** provides multiple benefits:

- **Optimized data analysis**: Helps divide large documents into manageable parts for more efficient processing.  
- **Improved response accuracy**: AI models can focus on specific fragments instead of analyzing an entire text.  
- **Reduced resource consumption**: Processing text in smaller segments prevents overload in AI models with token limits.  
- **Facilitates model training**: Helps structure data better, allowing AI to understand context more effectively.  
- **Faster information retrieval**: Dividing data into chunks enables quicker and more relevant searches.

## How Do Chunks Work?

The chunking process follows several key steps:

1. **Text segmentation**: A document or conversation is divided into fragments based on a predefined size of characters or words.  
2. **Preprocessing**: Irrelevant elements (whitespace, special characters) are removed to improve chunk quality.  
3. **Indexing and storage**: Chunks are stored with references to the original document to facilitate search and retrieval.  
4. **AI processing**: Each chunk is analyzed independently to generate responses or extract relevant information.  

> **Example of length-based segmentation:**  
> A document can be divided into **200-word chunks**, ensuring that each fragment contains complete and coherent information.

## Use of Chunks in Masscer

In **Masscer**, chunks play a key role in generating completions and retrieving information from documents and conversations.

### Applications in Masscer:

- **Generating document-based responses**: Masscer analyzes document chunks to generate precise answers.  
- **Training models with relevant content**: By dividing information, AI learns in a more structured way.  
- **Search optimization**: Segmenting data into chunks allows for faster and more efficient information retrieval.  

### How Chunks Are Generated in Masscer:

1. **Upload the document or conversation**: A file is uploaded, or a previous conversation is selected.  
2. **Automatic segmentation**: Masscer divides the content into chunks based on context optimization.  
3. **Indexing and storage**: Chunks are organized and linked to the original document.  
4. **AI processing**: Chunks are used to generate responses or extract relevant information.
